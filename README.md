## **Sierra Python Class**

**Hello, my name is Patrick Stack**

I'm a business intelligence practitioner, and have been coding for a while now. I'm excited to learn more about Python.

My college experience so far started in 1984:
- [x] AS in Computer Programming
- [x] BS in International Business
- [x] MBA with a focus on Information Systems and Data Analytics

I'm just taking Python to learn more current languages.

My computer experience so far is wide ranged. I've done pretty much everything from Database Administration, to information security,
to programming, networking, and business intelligence.

I am in Jared's class to learn Python. That seems like a pretty silly question, if you ask me. :)

In terms of what could prevent me from doing well in the class, I think the only thing would be work or personal life having
a crisis. Other than that, I can't think of anything that would prevent me from learning about Python.

The most important thing in my life is my friends and family.

Something interesting about me: I was born and grew up in Germany. I am fluent in two languages, and mostly fluent in a third.
